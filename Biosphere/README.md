# Biosphere
Biosphere is the Genetic Algorithm implementation for musinet.

## Usage
1. You must prepare a PKL-collection (ie. generated by musinet.py --prepare) as input PKL.
   Specify it either through command-line arguments `--initial` or by placing it at `data/random.pkl`.
2. Run ./run.py.
3. Enjoy coffee.
4. Ctrl-C to interrupt the process, or wait until an acceptable shows up.
5. Biosphere automatically spits out `output/best.pkl` file for you.
6. `musinet.py --convert` it.
